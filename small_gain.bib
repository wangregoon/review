  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the stability of networks consisting of nonlinear ISS systems supplied with ISS Lyapunov functions defined in dissipative form. The problem of constructing an ISS Lyapunov function for the network is addressed. Our aim is to provide a geometrical condition of a small gain type under which this construction is possible and to describe a method of an explicit construction of such an ISS Lyapunov function. In the dissipative form, the geometrical approach allows us to discuss both Lipschitz continuous construction and continuously differentiable construction of ISS Lyapunov functions.},

  Review                   = {In this paper we have pursued the construction of Lyapunov functions for nonlinear ISS systems interconnected in a general way, and introduced a geometrical approach based on the existence of some auxiliary functions. We assume that each system is given by a dissipation inequality of the ISS type, which contrasts with previous results on general interconnected systems supplied with the implication-type ISS characterization. With the help of the dissipative characterization, this paper has proposed two formulations whose solutions, i.e., auxiliary functions, explicitly provide us with smooth and non-smooth Lyapunov functions, respectively, of the interconnected system. For the non-smooth construction, the auxiliary function can be found explicitly. The existence condition has been related to a generalized small gain condition. For the smooth construction, we have shown how the auxiliary function can be found explicitly in a special case of supply rate functions. Although computing the auxiliary function for general supply rates is a matter of future investigations, the special case indicates that the smooth formulation has potential for dealing with iISS systems. We have also discussed an existence condition for the auxiliary function in the smooth construction. As in Remark 4.3, its small gain type interpretation is only a conjecture which needs to be investigated further although the conjecture holds true in a special case of supply rates. We also hope to relax the technical assumption $0 < c < (¦Ò_i\circ ¦Á_i ) '(\tau) < C$ in Theorem 4.5 for the non-smooth construction. Dealing with general networks of iISS systems
along the lines of this paper is also an interesting topic of further study.}
